<h1><b>Re:ElieenDover university application</b></h1>
<p>Dear Eileen</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>of your <u>PhD</u> next year.I will answer your questions one by one,in the following sections</p>
<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you<br>could start at the beginning of a semester;the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
  <li>First Semester:9 September 2016</li>
  <li>First Semester:15 january 2017</li>
  <li>First Semester:2 May 2017</li>
<p>please let me know if thi is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer</p>
<p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">important university dates</a> on our website</p>
<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded facility - as long as the subjects fall</p>
<p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reasearcher, and just</p>
<p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
<p>by are as follows, in order of priority:
<br>
<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benifits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>(86<sup>o</sup>), when the
    <<p>audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li></p>
<li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you'd expect the</p>
<p>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
<p>Yes,you are right!As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dance.To answer your questions,<br>my favorite dance are as follows,with definition:</p>
<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice the dance,which</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he through this dance inspired</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
<p>Artic robot dance</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discovered a new dance style charecterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they were really cold.</p>
<br>
<p>For more of my research,see my <a href="https://www.google.co.in/">exotic dance research page.</a>
<p>Yours sincerely,
<p>Dr R.Sruthi</p>
